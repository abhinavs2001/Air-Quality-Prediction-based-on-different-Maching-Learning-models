# Air Quality Prediction based on different Maching Learning models

## DESCRIPTION
Air is what keeps humans alive. Monitoring it and understanding its quality is of immense importance to our well-being. Therefore in this project I tried to find out  the air quality of a particular place using different parameters. The dataset contains concentrations of NO2, NOx, NH3, CO, SO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10 at daily level of various stations across multiple cities in India.

## TASKS:
1) Calculate AQI values from given parameters
2) Create a Model to Predict the quality of air.
3) Identify the Most polluted City based on AQI value
4) Compared results of different Machine Learning algorithms like Linear Regerssion, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine to obtain 
   model with best accuracy.


In this project, I tried to find out the Air Quality Index using concentrations of NO2, NOx, NH3, CO, SO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10. Once the AQI was found out, I categorised the air quality in different categories which included good, satisfactory, moderate, poor, very poor and severe.  

One could find out the air quality at a particular place in realtime, provided concentration of above mentioned pollutants is known.


## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
Jupyter Notebook , Python IDE

## LANGUAGES USED
Python, Machine Learning Algorithms.

## LIBRARIES USED
Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, sklearn

## CONCLUSION
By comparison, I concluded that the classification accuracy can be improved by introducing the statistical features. By comparing the classification performances of SVM, Logistic Regression, RF, Linear Regression, we can find that RF performs best on the dataset.
